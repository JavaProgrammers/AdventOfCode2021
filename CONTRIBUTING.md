# Contributing
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting your solutions
- Fixing typos
- Adding problem statement to the README of `DAY0x`

## Pull Request Process
1. Fork the project into your GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository on your local machine.
3. Create **a new branch** (such as `day01-java`). Be sure to create a separate branch for each solution you add.
4. Do your work on the **new branch — not the master branch**.
5. Create a pull request. For an overview of pull requests, take a look at GitHub's [pull request help documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
6. In case your pull request is not yet complete or not yet ready for review, consider creating a [draft pull request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) instead.
