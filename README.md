Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] project created by [Java Programmers][github].

In this repository, we provide solutions for the puzzles using different programming languages.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] – an annual event in December since 2015.
    Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
    A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
